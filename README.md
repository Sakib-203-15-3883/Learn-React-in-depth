# Interview questions : 
1. Simple Component Rendering :   Create a React component that renders a basic card with information passed as props.
  
2. Conditional Rendering :  Implement a component that conditionally renders different content based on a prop value (e.g., showing different list of items based on user clicked).
  
3. Form Handling :  Build a form component with input fields for name and email. Implement an event handler to capture input values and display them on submission. Add basic reset feature .
 
4.  search Handling:  Design a React component to implement a search functionality. The component should feature a search box allowing users to input search queries, complemented by a search icon to initiate the search. Implement the search trigger functionality to respond to both Enter key presses and clicks on the search icon. Upon searching , dynamically display matching elements over the UI.
  
5. complete given task : Goals 1. Add a search functionality to filter phones. 2. Implement sorting options for phones (ascending and descending). 3. Display the total count of phones. 4.Give feedback if no phones match the search query.

6. You are tasked with enhancing a sports application. The application currently displays an array containing the names of three sports. The goal is to implement a feature that allows users to dynamically add a new sport to the list. Once a new sport is added, the updated list should be rendered on the user interface.
Requirements: Use React for the frontend development. Initially, the array should contain the names of three sports: "Football," "Basketball," and "Tennis." Implement a feature that lets users input the name of a new sport. Provide a mechanism, such as a button click or Enter key press, for users to submit the new sport name. Update the state with the new list of sports using the functional form of setState. Clear the input field after successfully adding a new sport. Render the updated list on the user interface.


# React concepts
1.Why react ?

2.Basic of components [ Modularity, consistency , efficiency, maintainability ] 

3.JSX 

4.import & export statement

5.Dynamic and reuseable component.  [ here , i use map method to iterate data ] 

6. Dummy static To Do App UI . [  I try to create this dummy ui with reusable components with modularity , consistancy , efficiency and maintainability .

here , I create 3 components as button , input_task & to display task data , i create task_data component . At last , i bringing everything together at root component which is To Do App . here i pass data to component as props  ]

7. Fragments
8. Rendering lists using Map Method,
9. Conditional Rendering. [ using ternary operator ? , using logical operator &&, Learn  when we use which operator for conditional rendering ]
